# Movie Data Analysis for Microsoft

**Author**: [Christie Sarver](mailto:christie.sarver@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project uses several sources related to movie releases and performance to define and analyze what makes a successful movie. It will display results that can be used in decision making for a movie studio creation venture.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is interested in developing original video content to remain competitive in the tech world by creating a movie studio. This project will examine the movie industry to provide a set of recommendations on where to get started. 

## Parameters

For the purposes of this analysis I have chosen to look at US market data only, and to examine only films that have been released in the past 10 years. This decision is based on the context of how much the film and tv industry has changed in the past decade with the entry of streaming services as major movie studio contenders. 

## Data

Several data sets have been explored, but the following are included in the results:

* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

## Measures of Success

* Positive return on investment: Because ultimately, a successful business venture makes money.
* High user ratings: We want people to like the movie! This will (hopefully) help generate word-of-mouth promotion and social media chat to spread positive opinion.
* High critical ratings: Strong critical reviews mean positive press, which will capture media attention. Having clout in the industry as well can mean getting put up for awards, which can be a great set up to draw in better talent to future films, and better funding from potential investors




## Results

Most animals have short stays at AAC (under 15 days) but some have long stays (over 180 days), and most of these are dogs.

The total number of sheltered animals typically peaks in May of each year and then hits its lowest point around January. There is often a secondary peak sometime after May before the number of sheltered animals drops rapidly. The number of sheltered animals has dropped precipitously in 2020, likely as a result of COVID-19.

### Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for getting started with developing movies:

### Next Steps

For further analyis, recommended approaches are below:

* An analysis on press/awards for different titles and studios and this has affected revenue, particulary new entries such as Netflix and Amaxon Prime Video
* A market research analysis of the movie industry during Covid-19, and how established players are adapting to this challenging environment
