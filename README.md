# Movie Data Analysis for Microsoft

**Author**: [Christie Sarver](mailto:christie.sarver@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project uses several sources related to movie releases and performance to define and analyze what makes a successful movie. It will display results that can be used in decision making for a movie studio creation venture.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is interested in developing original video content to remain competitive in the tech world by creating a movie studio. This project will examine the movie industry to provide a set of recommendations on where to get started. 

## Parameters

For the purposes of this analysis I have chosen to look at US market data only, and to examine only films that have been released in the past 10 years. This decision is based on the context of how much the film and tv industry has changed in the past decade with the entry of streaming services as major movie studio contenders. 

## Data

Several data sets have been examined and interpreted from the following sources:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

## Methods





## Results

There are four deliverables for this project:

1. A **GitHub repository**
2. A **Jupyter Notebook**
3. A non-technical presentation **slide deck**
4. A non-technical presentation **recording**


### Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for getting started with developing movies:

### Next Steps

For further analyis, recommended approaches are below:

* An analysis on press/awards for different titles and studios and this has affected revenue, particulary new entries such as Netflix and Amaxon Prime Video
* A market research analysis of the movie industry during Covid-19, and how established players are adapting to this challenging environment
